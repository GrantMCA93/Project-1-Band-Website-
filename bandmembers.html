        <h2 style="text-align:left">Peter Tork</h2>
        <p>Peter Halsten Thorkelson was born on February 13, 1942, in Washington D.C.  He is the son of John and Virginia Thorkelson and sibling of a sister and two brothers.  As a child, his family moved to Connecticut, where some of his family still lives today.  Even as a young boy, Peter showed musical talent and could play the guitar and banjo.  In the early 60s, he left home to join the Greenwich Village folk scene where he performed for a few years before making the big move to Los Angeles, CA in the mid-60s, when he changed his name to Tork. 

In the fall of 1965, Peter's good friend, Stephen Stills, encouraged him to go audition for a new TV show about a Beatles-like band.  Soon after, he was chosen to become a member of the TV and music smash, "The Monkees."  Though The Monkees were still very popular, Tork left the group at the end of 1968 due to personal and professional reasons.  </p>

After the break-up of the Monkees, Nesmith continued his successful songwriting and performing career, first with the seminal country rock group the First National Band, with whom he had a top-40 hit "Joanne", and then as a solo artist. He is a noted player of the twelve-string guitar, performing on custom-built twelve-string electric guitars with the Monkees (built by Gretsch) and various twelve-string acoustic models during his post-Monkees career.

He is also an executive producer of the cult film Repo Man (1984). In 1981, Nesmith won the first Grammy Award given for Video of the Year for his hour-long television show, Elephant Parts.</p>
