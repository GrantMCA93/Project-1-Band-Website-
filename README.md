Project1_user_centric_frontend_dev

The project was to design a frontend website for the 1960s Rock band The Monkees.  This website was created for current and to attract potential new fans of the band. The website showcases some of the bands back catalogue in audio and video form. The booking page of the website allows fans to book the band for various upcoming events. To allow fans to stay connected with the band the footer of each page contains links to all the bands major social media accounts.

*-UX-*

The process used when designing this website started from an idea given in the video on the “additional advice” [1] page in the code institute course recommending the use of websites [2] and [3] for design ideas. Using these websites as well as looking at other bands websites to see what works. I found [4] which is the basic design used for the header and footer on the website. The basic layout for the rest of the website is taken from [5], where the website pages consist of a static background image with a strollable box contain the content of that page.
